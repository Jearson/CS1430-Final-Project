'queries.txt' will be where you tell unsplash the 
<query>,<num_pgs>,<dirname in imgs folder>
in that order to organize the downloaded images.

Then type:
	python3 download_images.py 
to download all of the queries in queries.txt

Stuff will print, so hopefully it's clear what's going on.

Lmk know if there's anything you want changed or clarified
